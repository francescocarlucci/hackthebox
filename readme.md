# HackTheBox Notes

A repo containing the boxes I solved on [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), history of commands and some inlined notes.

You may find some writeups (in future) on [frenxi.com](https://frenxi.com/).

Awesome writups are also available within the platform itself and on Medium.
